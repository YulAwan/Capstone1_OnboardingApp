# AWS Cloud Institute Capstone Project

Over 10 labs at **AWS Cloud Institute**, I built a **serverless customer onboarding app** for AnyCompany Bank using AWS services.

The solution automates customer verification using **AI/ML services** like:

- **Rekognition** for facial matching
- **Textract** for extracting data from uploaded documents

It also integrates key AWS services such as:

- **Amazon S3** for secure document storage
- **DynamoDB** for metadata management
- **Lambda** for serverless logic
- **SNS/SQS** for communication and queuing

I built and deployed my Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) using the **AWS SAM template**.

One critical moment in this project was refactoring the architecture to implement **Step Functions** and the state machine. This was my first experience using Step Functions in a development process, and it was a game-changer. It leverages **parallel states** to process multiple document types asynchronously, ensuring faster performance.

To enhance monitoring and debugging, I also added **AWS X-Ray tracing** to monitor both the Step Functions workflow and individual Lambda functions. This made performance tuning and troubleshooting much more efficient.
